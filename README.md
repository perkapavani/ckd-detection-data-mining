# ckd-detection-data-mining
A machine learning project for detecting Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) using data mining techniques like KNN, SVM, and Random Forest.
# CKD Detection Using Data Mining

This project applies data mining techniques to detect Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD). Models used include K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest. A GUI is also provided using Tkinter.

## Features
- Data Preprocessing and Cleaning
- Model Training and Evaluation
- GUI for User Input and Prediction
- Confusion Matrix and Accuracy Report

## Dataset
The dataset is obtained from [UCI CKD Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Chronic_Kidney_Disease)

## Run
```bash
python GUI/ckd_gui.py
